Josephus Permutation

while do some practice on codewars
i found Josephus Permutation task
and it is looked very interesting

My solution for Josephus_Permutation works but not good enough, because of Perfomance 
in current solution - it is a good example of the need to calculate the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm.
Commonly the time grows as the array grows. :)

Hope to find better solution soon.
